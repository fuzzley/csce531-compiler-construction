CSCE 531 HW2: Evaluating Expressions
============================

Using bison, flex and c to parse and evaluate basic mathematical expressions. All expressions are numbered and stored in a tree-like structure internally. The values for these stored trees are cached. The ability to refer to older expressions is exposed with the #n operator, where n is the number of the saved expression.
